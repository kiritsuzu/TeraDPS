      <h2 class="page-header">What is the Top Ranker system?
      </h2>
      <p>The Top Ranker system was created to allow exceptionally skilled players to represent themselves on TeraDPS by leaving a lasting impression with top ranks. Due to TeraDPS expiring all non-premium records, there was no way to save encounter data for players who could not afford premium subscriptions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Top ranks reward players for reaching record-level DPS scores by giving them permanent spots on the rankings, until they are 'beaten' by another record-level score. With this system in place, even players who are unable to afford subscriptions to TeraDPS can display their skill by achieving top
        ranks for their specific class/region on specific bosses.

      <h2 class="page-header">How do top ranks work? How does placement work?
      </h2>
      <p>The top ranker system stores a limited number of rankings permanently on the server based on the very top scoring entries.</p>

      <p class="text-center text-headline animated pulse infinite">
        <strong>There are only 5 top rank spots available per boss, per class, per region!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>When an exceptionally high score is uploaded to TeraDPS, it will have a chance to be added as a top rank. However, it must be higher than one of the scores in its current top rank bracket. If it is higher than another top rank score in its bracket,
        <strong>it will take the place of said score</strong>. As a result, the defeated score will be deleted from the rankings, while the new score will be added as a permanent top rank score.</p>
      <p>Please understand that while top ranks CAN be permanent, if they are beaten by a new score, they will be removed.</p>

      <h2 class="page-header">What does a top ranker score look like?
      </h2>
      <p>Top rankers can be noted by a lightning bolt icon:
        <i class="fa fa-bolt fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        next to their entry in the rankings. An example of a typical personal ranking can be seen below.</p>
      <center>
        <img src="/asset/toprankexample.png">
        <p>The top rank is accompanied by
          <i class="fa fa-bolt" aria-hidden="true"></i>, premium ranks are
          <i class="fa fa-star fa-spin" aria-hidden="true"></i>, and normal ranks do not have any special icon.</p>
      </center>

    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <h2 class="page-header">Only one entry per player per ranking is allowed.
      </h2>
      <p>Players cannot have more than one spot on each ranking at any given time. This is to prevent monopolizing the rankings by a single player, and to give lower skilled players a chance at second/third/fourth/fifth place. If a player achieves a spot in the top rankings, then uploads another score for
        the same boss bracket, there are two scenarios:</p>
      <p>1. If the player's next score has a DPS rating that is higher than his/her previous top rank record, his spot will be updated with his new score.</p>
      <p>2. If the player's next score has a DPS rating that is lower than his/her previous top rank record, the entry will be placed as a normal expiring non-top-rank entry, regardless of if it is eligible for the top ranks.</p>
      <p>We appreciate your understanding in this matter, and hope to present more opportunities for skilled players to make it onto the top rankings.</p>

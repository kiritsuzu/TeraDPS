      </h2>
      <p>TeraDPS is an web application that was created by Nick, a full-stack software engineer and veteran player of Tera Online, after realizing there was no structured or organized way to share DPS data amongst his fellow players.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its main features include archiving and sharing of DPS meter result statistics. TeraDPS aims to empower TERA Online players by allowing them to communicate and compare battle statistics with one another, and bring the communities across the globe together as one. By sourcing from every part of the
        world, the application provides detailed statistics for many specific categories of the game, whether it be class, server, boss, or even specific players!
        <br>
        <br>
        Allowing users to share, view, and save detailed data on DPS performance, TeraDPS is a powerful resource for TERA’s global player communities to collaborate towards gaining more knowledge of the game’s intricate designs and demystifying common superstitions and hearsay with hard, solid data.</p>

          <h3 class="page-header">What are DPS Meters?
          </h3>
          <p>DPS Meters are a type of third-party software that allows advanced information tracking of battle performance for Tera Online. These programs are able to produce greatly detailed information of your character’s performance in any given battle. A few examples of useful information provided by the DPS meter can include stats such as average critical hit rate, detailed skill damage breakdowns, and debuff/buff uptime percentages. The majority of this information would be impossible to record manually, so the DPS meter is an invaluable resource for players who wish to improve their overall battle performance and skills.</p>
